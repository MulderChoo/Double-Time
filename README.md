## My Responsibility
I mainly worked on the overall **design** and **project management** of the game. I was involved in the gameplay, enemies and level design, using the Unity Engine heavily. I also ensured that progress on the game was always on track, utilizing **SCRUM** methodology to schedule our sprints to achieve our milestones set by our lecturers.
